This is a huge pack of all game assets I have ever created, completely free and public domain for you to enjoy, use, remix, share and simply do whatever you want :) It took me many years to create them and for that I want them to come to good use so I share them completely freely. Simply grab them and use them, copy-paste them, modify them, break them, without any legal or moral worries.

There are over 800 files of all types: 2D images, textures, 3D models, bitmap fonts, even sounds, of different styles and themes. See the preview image to get an idea of what's in the pack. You can find these scattered around the Internet on sites like opengameart, but here you can simply get them with a single click in one pack. Sure you can credit me if you use these but you don't have to.

All these assets have been created by me, drummyfish, from scratch (including creating my own fonts, palettes, recording custom sounds etc.) and I am releasing them under Creative Commons Zero 1.0 (CC0, https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) so that they are forever available to anyone without any restrictions whatsoever. There was no one else involved in the creation of this and I clearly and formally state I give this freely away which gives you the best safety you can get.
